*Hello and welcome to the [Coding is Easy in Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WmIr43fGqqxLMHV9g7Mz9Zrbnk3cp7EN?usp=sharing) resources. This README file captures the components of this folder and recommends an order to review them. Further resources are in the [PCR-IO YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqQF2dP12YiuMYL1gGg9_g-JiGeW_2GJv)*

[2.0 Getting started with Google Colab - Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_P-wHTn0T8pnxpxqjC43mNQlzYdn6p8NtN0LBgpiUaY/edit?usp=sharing)
This mini-guide points students to the resources to add Colab to their apps and links a video to help them navigate the application once inside. 

[2.1.1 Python Follow Along.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tRzJkHvWxt40SOWvQaNmS0Tqgjfee2q7?usp=sharing)
This Colab notebook has students follow along with Programming with Mosh’s video: [Python for Beginners - Learn Python in 1 Hour](https://youtu.be/kqtD5dpn9C8). The cells in the notebook make space and prompt students to try: hello world, variables, receiving input, type conversions, strings, arithmetic operators, comparison/logical operators, if statements, while loops, lists, for loops, the range function, and tuples.

[2.1.2 Test your knowledge](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16fYiqlev6szpszkHMBJ66KnNGF24epwM?usp=sharing)
This colab notebook houses a few “homework assignments” for students to work through. These are common in Python courses and culminates with the “christmas tree assignment” as written by Andrew Leaver-Fay. Notebook authored by [Ryan Caster](rwcaster@ucdavis.edu) .

[2.2.1_plotting_intro.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KD4q0y3cXfNd7GkhX_f9EPmbli5O5TiI?usp=sharing)
In this colab notebook, students will learn to import packages and apply their coding skills to do intro-level data visualizations with plots. This notebook assumes that students are working in a shared drive. If you’d like help getting a shared drive set up for your class, please reach out to . This notebook was authored by [Hugh Haddox](mailto:haddox@uw.edu).

[2.2.2_plotting_heatmaps.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qhPaKNR8ZziT6cDPond98Z2vcme0ujL0?usp=sharing)
In this colab notebook, students will learn to make heatmaps in Python. The code block is followed by a series of questions, asking students to interpret the data shown in the heatmap. This notebook was authored by [Hugh Haddox](mailto:haddox@uw.edu).
