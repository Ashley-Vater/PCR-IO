*The content in the [Communicate your results](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nNKDp6QgMAQ_hgCyTP8avOpkBWzEBkte?usp=sharing) module both can span and support students' work through the earlier modules but culminates with final presentations at the end of the research project.* 

[6.1 Intro to Science Communication](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14K-3pD8s0nPpqDb7qFUxXOjKIV5IXHDPWeRpxYXVKRM/edit?usp=sharing)
This slide deck asks students to think broadly about science communication and what it encompasses and what it means to be an effective communicator. The deck highlights the BioRender-based talk that makes an argument that life sciences are just emerging from their dark ages.
