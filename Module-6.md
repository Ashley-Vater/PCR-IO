*The content in the [Communicate your results](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nNKDp6QgMAQ_hgCyTP8avOpkBWzEBkte?usp=sharing) module both can span and support students' work through the earlier modules but culminates with final presentations at the end of the research project.* 

[7.1 Intro to Science Communication](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14K-3pD8s0nPpqDb7qFUxXOjKIV5IXHDPWeRpxYXVKRM/edit?usp=sharing)
This slide deck asks students to think broadly about science communication and what it encompasses and what it means to be an effective communicator. The deck highlights the BioRender-based talk that makes an argument that life sciences are just emerging from their dark ages. 

[7.2 Twitter + Science](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AgI3mwqhTW6vw3gmu65HasTbiLcx84RF1r_bTmmTDN8/edit?usp=sharing)
This slide deck introduces and exemplifies how twitter is commonly used for science communication with a series of screen captures of effective tweets.

[7.2.1. Twitter Handles to Follow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PMttpnyqZ8jctxKKgqS2uOGwqz233lhvVSfHRvxI6A4/edit?usp=sharing)
This list is an incomplete and ever expanding list of twitter handles that students new-to-Rosetta might find helpful to follow. This document is shared so that anyone can edit. Please continue to add to this list. Iâ€™m sure this community will find many glaring holes! 

[7.3 The Art of Figure Making](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zmt7bmToAh1LMnJfKCVLVpueAKmCB3Y6refPfY8KDKk/edit?usp=sharing)
This slide deck briefly covers a few basic graphic design principles, like contrast and alignment, and then goes on to show examples of PyMol figures that work well and a few examples of PyMol figure makeovers. The deck concludes with a list of resource links.
